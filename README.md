ACE-Encode
==========

ACE - Encode (Automatic CD/DVD/BluRay Ripping &amp; Encoding).

ACE-Encode was born from the need to have an automatic CD/DVD/BluRay ripper and then ultimately an encoder for the ripped files.

There are many options out there already but many are limited to different Linux versions, I'd like to think that this application can be adapted to all Linux distros that you can load all applications onto.

The requirements for 100% use of this application are:
- Ubuntu (or some variation of Linux)
- BASH Shell
- DVDBackup
- MakeMKV
- ABCDE
- HandBrake
- XBMC (Local or Remote will work)
