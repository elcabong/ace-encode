{"name":"ACE - Encode","tagline":"ACE - Encode (Automatic CD/DVD/BluRay Ripping & Encoding)","body":"# Welcome to ACE - Encode.\r\nACE-Encode was born from the need convert a whole CD/DVD/BluRay library (450+) into music & movie files readable on a Home Theater PC (HTPC).\r\n\r\nACE-Encode works by automatically ripping an inserted CD/DVD/BluRay to a folder (WARNING: Each BluRay can take up to 35+ GB of storage).\r\n\r\nFrom there you can manually run (or as a CRON job) the encoder for DVD/BluRay which will convert the ripped folders to a usable (and smaller) movie file.\r\n\r\nIf you have a program such as CouchPotato, you can configure a \"Black Hole\" directory where CouchPotato will pick up the encoded movie, download all the appropriate METADATA and movie information and add the file to your media playing program (We use XBMC).\r\n\r\nThere are a few applications that do a similar thing, but many are limited to different Linux versions or even Windows, I'd like to think that this application can be adapted to all versions of Linux.\r\n\r\nTo make the most of all the features in this application, we recommend the installation of the following:\r\n* Ubuntu (or some variation of Linux)\r\n* BASH Shell\r\n* DVDBackup\r\n* MakeMKV\r\n* ABCDE\r\n* HandBrake\r\n* XBMC (Local or Remote will work)\r\n* CouchPotato\r\n\r\nFor help with the installation of each of these features please read the INSTALL section below.\r\n\r\n# Installation of ACE-Encode\r\n\r\n### Step 1: Install GIT (if you don't already have it installed)\r\nYou may install ACE-Encode on Ubuntu by downloading the latest version from a .zip or .tar.gz and extracting it. But I recommend installing and running it from the GitHub source (to keep up with the latest features and bug fixes) using git as the updater. If you do not have git installed already, install it using the command below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ sudo apt-get install git-core\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Step 2: Install ACE-Encode on Ubuntu\r\n\r\nFirst, if you already have a _/usr/bin/ace-encode_ folder on your computer from a previous version you should remove or rename the previous folder. If your previous ACE-Encode is saved in the default installation location then from there do the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd /usr/bin\r\n$ sudo mv ace-encode ace-encode-old\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter your new ACE-Encode installation is running and you have recovered any settings you need, you can delete the previous version’s folder (ace-encode-old).\r\n\r\nNext, you will need to clone a copy of ACE-Encode from the master git repository:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd /usr/bin\r\n$ sudo git clone git://github.com/joelbassett/ACE-Encode.git ace-encode\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will download the current revision of ACE-Encode to the folder ace-encode. \r\n\r\n### Step 3: Configure ACE-Encode\r\n\r\nIf you have used GIT to install ACE-Encode to the above directory, start with:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd /usr/bin/ace-encode\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe will then need to ensure that ACE-Encode is executable by the user that you are logged in as. Replace {USERNAME} with the user you will be ripping files as:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ sudo chmod +x ./*\r\n$ sudo chown {USERNAME}:{USERNAME} ./*\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext we will need to change the settings for ACE-Encode:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ nano ./settings.conf\r\n```\r\nThe important settings to adjust are the following:\r\n* **GLOBAL_ENABLE_XBMC** - Enable XBMC Connectivity (1 = on, 0 = off)\r\n* **GLOBAL_XBMC_HOST** - XBMC Host that you wish to notify and update the library of (127.0.0.1 is the default)\r\n* **GLOBAL_ENABLE_EMAIL** - Enable Email Connectivity (1 = on, 0 = off)\r\n* **GLOBAL_EMAIL** - Email address to send notifications to\r\n* **GLOBAL_SOURCE_DRIVE** - The path for your DVD/BluRay drive (/dev/sr0 is default)\r\n* **GLOBAL_LOG_DIR** - Directory to save the application logs (/data/Ripping/logs is default)\r\n* **ENABLE_DVD** - Enable DVD Ripping & Encoding (1 = on, 0 = off)\r\n* **DVD_OUTPUT_DIR** - Directory to save the Ripped DVDs in (/data/Ripping/DVD is default)\r\n* **ENABLE_BLURAY** - Enable DVD Ripping & Encoding (1 = on, 0 = off)\r\n* **BLURAY_OUTPUT_DIR** - Directory to save the Ripped BluRays in (/data/Ripping/BR is default)\r\n\r\nAll further settings are detailed in the CONFIGURATION section.\r\n\r\n### Step 4: Enable automatic CD/DVD/BluRay ripping\r\n\r\nStep 4 takes into account that you have ABCDE, DVDBackup, MakeMKV & HandBrake installed and working correctly. For help installing any of the above, please see the INSTALLATION section for each extension.\r\n\r\nTo enable automatic ripping, first we need to create the definitions for each of the automatically started programs.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd /usr/bin/ace-encode\r\n$ sudo cp ./autorun/.abcde.conf ~\r\n$ sudo cp ./autorun/ripcd.desktop /usr/share/applications/\r\n$ sudo cp ./autorun/ripdvd.desktop /usr/share/applications/\r\n$ sudo cp ./autorun/ripbluray.desktop /usr/share/applications/\r\n$ sudo chmod +x ~/.abcde.conf\r\n$ sudo chmod +x /usr/share/applications/ripcd.desktop\r\n$ sudo chmod +x /usr/share/applications/ripdvd.desktop\r\n$ sudo chmod +x /usr/share/applications/ripbluray.desktop\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext we need to open the file _mimeapps.list_:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ sudo nano ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd add the following at the bottom of the file:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[Default Applications]\r\nx-content/audio-cdda=ripcd.desktop;\r\nx-content/video-dvd=ripdvd.desktop;\r\nx-content/video-bluray=ripbluray.desktop\r\n[Added Associations]\r\nx-content/audio-cdda=ripcd.desktop;\r\nx-content/video-dvd=ripdvd.desktop;\r\nx-content/video-bluray=ripbluray.desktop;\r\n```\r\n\r\nSave the file and then in Ubuntu go to System Settings > Details > Removable Media and then do the following:\r\n* **For CD** - Click on the Audio CD drop down, you’ll notice our Rip CD program is listed. Choose this as your default. \r\n* **For DVD** - Click on the DVD Video Disc drop down, you’ll notice our Rip DVD program is listed. Choose this as your default. \r\n* **For BluRay** - Click on the Additional Settings button and find the option for Bluray Video Disc, you’ll notice our Rip BluRay program is listed. Choose this as your default. \r\n\r\nIf all your programs have been installed and set up correctly, you should now be able to insert a disc of your choosing and it will automatically rip the music or movie to your computer.\r\n\r\n### Step 5: CD/DVD/BluRay encoding\r\n\r\nAs DVD/BluRay encoding can be a very personal thing (quality vs size), I would prefer to run my encoding on demand. However the scripts are there and can be setup to run on a CRON script (If you have a large amount of encoding, I'd recommend only once a month).\r\n\r\nWhen you change the VIDEO & AUDIO settings for each of the DVD & BluRay settings, I would recommend running the first pass manually to get a feel for how long each DVD/BR file will take to encode. Then based on the number of files, you can decide on which CRON job to create.\r\n\r\nI will update this section in the future with a CRON script.\r\n\r\nTo automatically encode all ripped DVDs, use the following command:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ sudo /usr/bin/ace-encode/dvd-encode\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo automatically encode all ripped BluRays, use the following command:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ sudo /usr/bin/ace-encode/bluray-encode\r\n```\r\n\r\n### UPDATING TO LATEST VERSION\r\n\r\nAt a later stage, to update to a current revision of ACE-Encode, just go into _/usr/bin/ace-encode_ folder and type:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ sudo git pull\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Credits / Authors / Contributors\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with ACE-Encode? \r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-28070130-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
